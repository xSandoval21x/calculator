<h1>Project Reflection</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>It was difficult at first to try and manipulate all the variables and keep
        everything organized</li>  
    <li>I learned that making a calculator object using a class would make the handling of
    variables easier</li>
    <li>I am getting more comfortable with adding event listeners and DOM manipulation</li>
    <li>Using CS Grid to make the calculator layout worked wonders, it was very simple to use</li>
    <li>I am getting more comfortable with CSS styling and getting elements where I want them</li>
    <li>The chrome dev tools was a valuable asset when checking the functionaluty of my javascript</li>
  </ul>
