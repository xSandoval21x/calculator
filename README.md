### Project Reflection
* It was difficult at first to try and manipulate all the variables and keep everything organized
* I learned that making a calculator object using a class would make the handling of variables easier
* I am getting more comfortable with adding event listeners and DOM manipulation
* Using CS Grid to make the calculator layout worked wonders, it was very simple to use
* I am getting more comfortable with CSS styling and getting elements where I want them
* The chrome dev tools was a valuable asset when checking the functionaluty of my javascript
